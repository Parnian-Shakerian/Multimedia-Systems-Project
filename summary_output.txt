Summary:
"But remember how you went eighty–seven days without fish and then we caught big ones every day for three weeks."
"But you went turtle–ing for years off the Mosquito Coast and your eyes are good."
There was no cast net and the boy remembered when they had sold it.
"How would you like to see me bring one in that dressed out over a thousand pounds?"
"Then live a long time and take care of yourself," the old man said.
But then I think of Dick Sisler and those great drives in the old park."
"If Durocher had continued to come here each year your father would think him the greatest manager."
He rolled his trousers up to make a pillow, putting the newspaper inside them.
They had coffee from condensed milk cans at an early morning place that served fishermen.
He was very fond of flying fish as they were his principal friends on the ocean.
Some of the younger fishermen, those who used buoys as floats for their lines and had motorboats, bought when the shark livers had brought much money, spoke of her as el mar which is masculine.
But the old man always thought of her as feminine and as something that gave or withheld great favours, and if she did wild or wicked things it was because she could not help them.
Each sardine was hooked through both eyes so that they made a half–garland on the projecting steel.
Each line, as thick around as a big pencil, was looped onto a green–sapped stick so that any pull or touch on the bait would make the stick dip and each line had two forty–fathom coils which could be made fast to the other spare coils so that, if it were necessary, a fish could take out over three hundred fathoms of line.
He kept them straighter than anyone did, so that at each level in the darkness of the stream there would be a bait waiting exactly where he wished it to be for any fish that swam there.
Just then he saw a man–of–war bird with his long black wings circling in the sky ahead of him.
He made a quick drop, slanting down on his back–swept wings, and then circled again.
But these poisonings from the agua mala came quickly and struck like a whiplash.
Most people are heartless about turtles because a turtle's heart will beat for hours after he has been cut up and butchered.
He ate them all through May to be strong in September and October for the truly big fish.
But now he said his thoughts aloud many times since there was no one that they could annoy.
"If the others heard me talking out loud they would think that I am crazy," he said aloud.
Just then, watching his lines, he saw one of the projecting green sticks dip sharply.
Now he could let it run through his fingers without the fish feeling any tension.
At that moment he felt him stop moving but the weight was still there.
The position actually was only somewhat less intolerable; but he thought of it as almost comfortable.
Never have I had such a strong fish nor one who acted so strangely.
Some time before daylight something took one of the baits that were behind him.
How did I let the fish cut me with that one quick pull he made?

"Now," he said, when his hand had dried, "I must eat the small tuna.
The fish had slowed again and was going at his usual pace.
I wonder how much he sees at that depth, the old man thought.
But the old man had raised his hand up to dead even again.
"With so much flying fish there should be dolphin," he said, and leaned back on the line to see if it was possible to gain any on his fish.
I would like to fly very slowly at two hundred fathoms high and see the fish from above.
Can it be anger, or the greater speed he makes that brings them out?
I had better keep the fish quiet now and not disturb him too much at sunset.
Also now I have gained on him in the question of sustenance.
Imagine if each day a man must try to kill the moon, he thought.
It is enough to live on the sea and kill our true brothers.
No matter what passes I must gut the dolphin so he does not spoil and eat some of him to be strong.
Rest now, old man, and let him work until your next duty comes.
How simple it would be if I could make the line fast, he thought.
It is too dangerous to rig the oars as a drag if you must sleep.
It looked now as though he were moving into a great canyon of clouds and the wind had dropped.
Rig now to get some sleep, old man, while the fish is calm and steady."
If it relaxes in sleep my left hand will wake me as the line goes out.
Even if I sleep twenty minutes or a half an hour it is good.
He looked back at the coils of line and they were feeding smoothly.
Could it have been hunger that made him desperate, or was he frightened by something in the night?
"You did not do so badly for something worthless," he said to his left hand.
"I could not fail myself and die on a fish like this," he said.
It may make him jump though and I would rather he stayed circling now.
His mouth was too dry to speak but he could not reach for the water now.
Keep your head clear and know how to suffer like a man.
I'll try it again, the old man promised, although his hands were mushy now and he could only see well in flashes.
He looked up at the sky and then out to his fish.
But I think the great DiMaggio would be proud of me today.
He cut a piece of line and tied the fish's lower jaw against his bill so his mouth would not open and they would sail as cleanly as possible.
I am only better than him through trickery and he meant me no harm.
He was built as a sword fish except for his huge jaws which were tight shut now as he swam fast, just under the surface with his high dorsal fin knifing through the water without wavering.
This was a fish built to feed on all the fishes in the sea, that were so fast and strong and well armed that they had no other enemy.

There is no translation for this word and perhaps it is just a noise such as a man might make, involuntarily, feeling the nail go through his hands and into the wood. "
It was an easy shot now and he felt the cartilage sever.
Then get your hand in order because there still is more to come.
Now is no time to think of what you do not have.
The old man watched for him to come again but neither shark showed.
But I have hurt them both badly and neither one can feel very good.
I should have chopped the bill off to fight them with, he thought.
But if I had, and could have lashed it to an oar butt, what a weapon.
"I'd like to buy some if there's any place they sell it," he said.
Luck is a thing that comes in many forms and who can recognize her?
I would take some though in any form and pay what they asked.
One came, finally, against the head itself and he knew that it was over.
The old man could hardly breathe now and he felt a strange taste in his mouth.
She is sound and not harmed in any way except for the tiller.
"Damn my fish," the boy said and he started to cry again.
But we will fish together now for I still have much to learn."
"We must get a good killing lance and always have it on board.
"Lie down, old man, and I will bring you your clean shirt.
