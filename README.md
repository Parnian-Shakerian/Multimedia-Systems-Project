### Overview
This repository contains a project that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to summarize books or large texts and provide an interactive question-answering system based on the summarized content. Users can input `.epub` files, `.txt` files, or webpage URLs. The project applies semantic embeddings, text chunking, summarization, keyword extraction, and sentiment analysis to enable efficient exploration of long-form textual content. 

+ **Data Processing Scripts**: Scripts to extract text from `.epub`, `.txt`, or web URLs, clean it, and chunk it for processing.  
+ **Summarization**: Code for generating summaries of text chunks using extractive methods.  
+ **Keyword Extraction**: Scripts using NLP techniques to identify important and less frequent keywords in the text.  
+ **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes polarity and subjectivity of summarized content.  
+ **Question Answering**: Implements semantic search and similarity-based retrieval to answer questions based on the summarized text.
